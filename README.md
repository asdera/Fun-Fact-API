# Fun-Fact-API
A REST API to get any fun fact based on a specific keyword or term! The first API I've built - webscrapes Wikipedia and formats a random fact.

### Examples
* Get a random fact on the [today's featured topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) - `GET https://wikifacts.herokuapp.com/facts`
* Get a fact on any specific topic/keyword specified by the path - Ex. `GET https://wikifacts.herokuapp.com/facts/philosophy`
